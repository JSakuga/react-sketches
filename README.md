# 🧠 React Learning Lab

Welcome to my personal **React Learning Lab**!
This repository contains hands-on experiments and mini-projects that helped me learn and master core React concepts.

## 🚀 What I’ve Learned

### 🔹 **React Fundamentals**

* ✅ **Components** – Building reusable UI pieces.
* ✅ **Props** – Passing data to components.
* ✅ **useState** – Managing local component state.
* ✅ **Events** – Handling user interactions.

### 👨‍👧 **Component Hierarchy**

* ✅ **Children** – Composing components inside others.
* ✅ **Lifting State Up** – Sharing state between components.
* ✅ **Derived State** – Computing state based on props or internal state.
* ✅ **Component Composition** – Building flexible UIs using slots and patterns.

### 🧠 **Side Effects & Lifecycle**

* ✅ **useEffect** – Executing side effects (e.g., fetch, subscriptions).
* ✅ **Cleanup in useEffect** – Cleaning up side effects (e.g., unsubscribe, clear timers).

### 🌐 **Working with Data**

* ✅ **Data Fetching** – Fetching API data and displaying it.
* ✅ **Custom Hooks** – Abstracting logic into reusable hooks.

### ⚙️ **Advanced React Tools**

* ✅ **Refs** – Accessing DOM elements and holding mutable values.
* ✅ **Lazy Initial State** – Initializing state only once with functions.
* ✅ **useReducer** – Managing complex state logic.

### 🌍 **App-Wide State & Routing**

* ✅ **Context API** – Sharing global state across components.
* ✅ **React Router** – Navigating between pages in a SPA.

## 📌 Purpose

This is a **learning-first** repo — not a production-grade app.
Every folder or component represents a concept or small app demonstrating a React feature.

## 📚 Stack

* **React** (Latest version)
* **React Router DOM**
* **ESLint + Prettier** (optional setup)
* No external UI libraries (learning raw JSX & CSS where possible)
